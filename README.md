# MSA-Cloud-Project-Specs
requirement section
The website present no technical issues, but it takes about 20sec to charge completely.
The use of two plugins for cache pushed the speed and efficency of the website
The GT-Metrix test provided a C for the performance, with a 10.1sec for fully charge and 112 request and 6.48MB of total page size.
I used a total of 8 plugins:
anti-spam- protect the blog from spam
classical page builder- drag &drop
template kits and photos- to have a user-friendly and catchy design
analytics- data is fundamental as much as SEO for create an audience
2 cache and optimisation providers- considered the low level of the server used it's necessary to push the results, will use the credit to increase the quality of the server use.
multilingual- english/italian, translation increase the audience solving the linguistic barriers
I implemented the template with elementor, using a theme for a website of creative design
I implemented the analytics creating an account with one of the most used web search engine
Considered the powerful use of colours and animations of the template I hope to involve the users to keep watching my website
Considered the increase of the speed, modifying some setting of the CSS, image and page optimisation, I hope to make the website lighter and faster
Considered the translation plugin I hope to make easier the comprehension and participation of the community
